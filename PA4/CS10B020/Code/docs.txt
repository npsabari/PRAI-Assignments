negative probability cases thus m sure given game add numbers team won add 1 game sometimes add one sometime less one also pitchers bad performances giving 6 runs may given large negative percentage game also batter pulled 04 night would give large negatives greg thinking right things intuition mark closers enormously important total number runs value outweighed come prevented comming doubling greg allows enough another article proposed test predict team wonlost record quite accurately looking many runs total score allow without regard runs score game late runs really important early runs looking late runs lead better predictor right really smaller sample size would think however number runs score first inning would good prediction many runs score last inning realize something else closer usually comes close situation blow hard argue runs closer gives game equal importance given first inning look closer giving runs often means team lose many games hand starter gives runs often still leaves team chance win offence many outs something saying late inning situations equally important either 8 runs ninth really matter many runs pitcher gives ninth another thought experiment apply method basketball find points scored first half game almost exactly value lead safe entire half yet play furthermore sub bench sinks winning free throws time clock gets 10 game star forward scored 27 points first half spraining ankle gets zero make sense would assume teams probability winning would 0 possesion free throws made look 1 point 5 seconds left fairly high probability win game

82814 daveb pogowvtekcom dave butler subject re new biblical contradictions still answered judas organization tektronix inc wilsonville lines 180 mr decenso spite requiring scholarly opinion hanging judas rejects scholarly opinion scholars rephrases scholars opinion subject know matthew hang acts probably records death although possible plausible fell hanging hit rocks thereby bursting open longer assume case therefore contradiction matthew say judas died result hanging scholars believe iprobably quoted show highly regard scholars explanations looking texts initially ca nt assume judas died however highly probable also nothing greek suggest success failure simply means hang oneself actually research greek word apacgw find denote success scholars indeed excellent reason assume suicide successful pointed recently checked several lexicons greek english lexicon new testament louw nida robinson greek english lexicon new testament greek english lexicon new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale greek english lexicon new testament early christian writings bauerarndtgingrich new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher couple simply stated hanged oneself couple explicit stated apacgw means specifically kill hanging couple also noted meaning one root words apacgw strangle throttle choke pretty much invalidates guy suggested david joslin judas hung upside one best references though robinson greek english lexicon new testament stated translation gave root words literal translation related greek words use roots also presented specific examples word greek literature give context word apagchw two root words gchw strangle root root word apo means literally away root words included words denote transition mean transition place eg greek word apagello means send message apo also denote change state specifically change life death robinson specifically makes comparison word apokteiuo means kill literal meaning word apacgw means throttle strangle put way implicitly denotes change life state ie away life death word apacgw mean hang specifically denotes death well thus robinson quite specific state means hang oneself end one life hanging notes use apacgw homers odessy 19230 denote context presents example apacgw used explicitly mean suicide hanging since perfectly good word strangling without added denotation death insist bible written god every word precicely correct stuck complete meaning apacgw ie since word apacgw used death denoted result way note mr decenso also presents example apacgw septuagint greek translation ot used time jesus used 2 samuel 1723 ahithophel saw advice followed saddled donkey arose went home house city put household order hanged died buried father tomb notice stated ahithophel hanged gr sept apagcho explicitly adds died doubt result matthew explicitly told judas died note mr decenso say septuagint translation hebrew greek shown original meaning hebrew ie hebrew say died thus whether simply echoed greek also pointed regardless added died correct translation would still apacgw man indeed die strangulation redundant correct evidence septuagint repeatedly rewritten reedited included versions contradicted editing even necessarily executed greeks thus sure use septuagint stands paragon ancient greek really need prove point mr decenso example ancient greek someone committing apacgw surviving otherwise would see simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence would note mr decenso everytime go way research one apparently contrived exegisis pretty much find false thus think going add text something source clearly says better explicit greek historical source justify way mr rose statement trees around potter field still trees around ledges rocky pavement bottom unless mr rose show trees two thousand years old 2000 year old stumps 2 thousand year old description area mentions trees inappropriate assert present placement trees prove location trees two thousand years ago things change argument ie money judas used 30 silvers second question mr decenso ask could sure money judas purchased land indeed betrayal rather source would point acts specifically mention reward iniquity acts 118 also specifically mentions act iniquity talking ie acts 116 concerning judas guide arrested jesus would point bible describes act iniquity immediately discusses reward iniquity would rather inane suggest action iniquity one discussed notice verse 16 word iniquity used rather states judas became guide arrested jesus writer stop vs 17 numbered us obtained part ministry part judas play ministry true peter author acts specifically call judas betrayal iniquity matter neither john specifically call judas actions iniquity either john 1329 say judas took money box rather said thought judas money box jesus telling buy need feast give something poor receiving morsel immediately went night note said judas left say took money box thus see explanation still seems would choose unproven iniquity mentioned another author different book written different time iniquity explicitly mentioned author acts find forced contrived course particular argument becomes moot since seen evidence apacgw means suicide see since judas hanging successful could spent money mentioned john 1329 matthew mark explicitly say betrayal high holy day ie passover thus could spent money killing next day thus money bought field blood would 30 pieces silver course got 30 pieces silver night well thus could nt spent either oh dear believe house cards comming maybe point discuss whether jesus crucified friday saturday part argument judas way prophesy potter field came ie mention matthew say please done study death remind discuss reminding discuss part verse discussing wish

program starts toolkits registering widgets resources fetched programs initializing state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically settles using pages using sleeps stagger launching clients xinitrc avoid fighting workstation limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many variables considered available ram local swap space load average number users system clients starting etc currently xinitrc situation like sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm ve

current setup simplicity probably experiment bit find setup suits fonts loading fonts takes time ram minimize number fonts applications use ll get speed increases loadup time one simple strategy choose small number fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits configure clients least heavily used clients use fonts client programs start quicker font already loaded server also conserve server resources since fewer fonts loaded server farrell mckay fbm ptcburpptcbuozau joe english joe trysteroartcom eg main xterm font 7x13 also twm set use 7x13 menus icons etc twm default font 8x13

resources file keep xresources xdefaults file small saves ram saves server startup time joe english joe trysteroartcom one suggestion xdefaults xresources file try putting minimum number resources

setenv xuserfilesearchpath homelibappdefaults n compwindowsx frequently asked questions faq contains excellent explanation environment variables work ed xterm launches loads resources appdefaultsxterm

organizing personal resources following benefits easier maintain usable fewer resources stored x server resourcemanager property side benefit server may start fractionally quicker since doesnt load resources applications process resources never sort resources find ones affect also drawbacks application interested load additional file every time starts nt seem make much performance difference might consider huge boon usability modifying application resource database need rerun application without xrdb xrdb default run xdefaults file cpp resources split multiple resource files loaded individual client programs watch c style comments xdefaults file cpp stripped switched method distributed resource files spent several frustrating days trying figure clients finding resources xt provide error message encountered c style comments resource files simply silently aborted processing resource file loss preprocessing handy eg ifdef color enough cause people dismiss method resource management may also run clients break rules example neither emacs 18583 xvt 10 find resources anywhere xdefaults starting client machine share files machine resources stored client find resources loading resources server guarantee clients always find resources casey leedom casey gaussllnlgov possible compromise suggestion planning trying put resources heavily used clients eg xterm xdefaults
